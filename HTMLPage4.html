	<h2>Math</h2>
	<p>What is the area that is unshaded within a 4 by 4 square that is at the origin<br>if there are five shaded circles in it. One circle with radius 1 in each of the<br>4
	quadrants and one that is centered at the origin and is the largest size that<br>it can be without overlaping with the four other circles?</p>

	<h2>Desmos Art</h2>
	<p>Make a graph of the YouTube logo (graph without equations shown on the<br>right) on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a>.</p>
	<img src="./youtubelogo.png" id="desmos-graph" height="600">

	<h2>Computer Science</h2>
	<p>Make a program on python which takes as input a string of digits (or other<br>symbols which the program will ignore).
	The program should then go to a specific point for each of the different digits (the specific point for each digit should not be the same point).
	The program should work for <strong>base 10 numbers</strong> but there may be extra credit awarded for working in other bases and taking the bases as input.</p>

	<p id="email">Please email your answers to <strong><a target="_blank" href="mailto:benjamin.taycher@gmail.com">benjamin.taycher@gmail.com</a></strong>. If you would like to, you may also email your solutions to the same email.
	If you got everything in the problem correctly then emailing your solution will not get you any extra points but if your answer was not correct, but some
	of the steps in you sollution were, you may get some of the points that you would not have gotten otherwise.</p>
