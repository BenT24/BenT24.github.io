	<h2 class="subtitle">Past Level 2 Problems</h2>

	<h3>Math</h3>
	<p>Bob has a triangle with a right angle where one leg is of length 3, another is of length 8. How long is the hypotenuse?</p>

	<h3>Desmos Art</h3>
	<p>Make a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a> graph of a point that moves around a circle using a slider.</p>

	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p>Make a python program that takes as input an integer and then draws a shape with that many corners.</p>

	<!--level 3 past problems-->
	<h2 class="subtitle">Past Level 3 Problems</h2>

	<h3>Math</h3>
	<p>What is the area that is unshaded within a 4 by 4 square that is at the origin<br>if there are five shaded circles in it. One circle with radius 1 in each of the<br>4
	quadrants and one that is centered at the origin and is the largest size that<br>it can be without overlaping with the four other circles?</p>

	<h3>Desmos Art</h3>
	<p>Make a graph of the YouTube logo (graph without equations shown on the<br>right) on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a>.</p>
	<img src="./youtubelogo.png" id="desmos-graph2" height="600">

	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p>Make a program on python which takes as input a string of digits (or other symbols which the program will ignore).
	The program should then go to a specific point for each of the different digits (the specific point for each digit should not be the same point).
	The program should work for <strong>base 10 numbers</strong> but there may be extra credit awarded for working in other bases and taking the bases as input.</p>
