	<h2 id="about-title">About</h2>
	<div id="about-text">
	<p>This website is a website made by Benjamin Taycher. Benjamin Taycher is a 12 year old male human being.
	He has programmed on Python, C#, JavaScript, as well as Html amd Css which are the ones that were used to make this program.
	</p>
	<p>The reason that Benjamin Taycher made this website is that he wanted to practice his skills in both HTML and CSS as
	well as wanting to make a website for other people to be able to go on a website that he made and then be able to answer
	questions and email them to him.</p>
	<p>The reason that Benjamin Taycher picked the topics: math, Desmos art, and computer science is that he is interested in
	all three of them himself and also wanted others to be interested in them. He has learned math from a math website called Aleks. He has learned about Desmos from his school
	but then went on to discover many of the possible ways to make art on Desmos life the minion (left) which was made entirely from equations
	that were made on desmos. Benjamin has been interested in learning about different programming languages for a lot of his life but had not been able to easily show other
	people his work unless he got them to physically come over to his computer to look at the program and/or what the program did when it was run.</p>
	</div>
	<h2 class="points">Points</h2>
	<p class="points">There will be points awarded to people who got the right answer and there may be points that are awarded to people who
	did not get the problem correctly but submitted a solution which was partially correct. There will be a leaderboard.
	The points from previous weeks will be worth less in the leaderboard that will contain the results of the next week's and of weeks that will be after that
	but they will still be worth an amount of points which may help you go up the leaderboard or at least not go down to the very bottom if you
	do not do the problems in one of the week. The level 1 problems are worth 5 points in the week that they are the current probems,
	the level 2 problems are worth 7, and the level 3 problems are worth 9 points.</p>
