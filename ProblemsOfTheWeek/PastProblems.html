	<h3>Math</h3>
	<p>What is the area that is unshaded within a 4 by 4 square that is at the origin<br>if there are five shaded circles in it. One circle with radius 1 in each of the<br>4
	quadrants and one that is centered at the origin and is the largest size that<br>it can be without overlaping with the four other circles?</p>

	<h3>Desmos Art</h3>
	<p>Make a graph of the YouTube logo (graph without equations shown on the<br>right) on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a>.</p>

	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<p>Make a program on python which takes as input a string of digits (or other symbols which the program will ignore).
	The program should then go to a specific point for each of the different digits (the specific point for each digit should not be the same point).
	The program should work for <strong>base 10 numbers</strong> but there may be extra credit awarded for working in other bases and taking the bases as input.</p>
